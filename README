Becki
=====

Becki is a front end of the IoT connectivity solution developed by MEDIA CHECK.

It integrates all the back end services and provides a nice portable interface
for users as well as for administrators.

Features
--------

Refer to the test suite for the complete list of all the features and use cases.
The project is not in the final shape yet. Further features are added on demand
if they fit the purpose of the program.

License
-------

For the time being, we retain all rights. That means that you are not allowed to
distribute, reproduce or modify this project.

Requirements
------------

In order to serve the front end through HTTP, an HTTP server is required because
current web browsers implement a variety of safety measures that may prevent the
front end from functioning if accessed otherwise. Server-side dependencies can
be installed using [npm][] not less than 2.14.0 and less than 3.0.0. Install it
and see the installation instructions below.

On the other side, clients must support [HTML5][] and JavaScript.

Installation
------------

1. Configure the HTTP server to serve the top-level directory of this
   distribution.

2. In that directory:

   1. Run `npm install --production` in order to install the application
      dependencies.

   2. Run `npm run-script compile` in order to compile the sources into
      JavaScript.

Contributions
-------------

Following commands of [npm][] not less than 2.14.0 and less than 3.0.0 might be
useful during a development:

* `npm run-script install:dev` to install the development dependencies.

* `npm start` to start a HTTP server that serves the application at
  <http://0.0.0.0:8080/>.

* `npm test` to run application tests. The tests expect the tested front end
  instance to be available at <http://127.0.0.1:8080/>.
