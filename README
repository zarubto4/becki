Becki
=====

Becki is a front end of the IoT connectivity solution developed by MEDIA CHECK.

It integrates all the back end services and provides a nice portable interface
for users as well as for administrators.

License
-------

For the time being, we retain all rights. That means that you are not allowed to
distribute, reproduce or modify this project.

Requirements
------------

In order to serve the front end through HTTP, an HTTP server is required because
current web browsers implement a variety of safety measures that may prevent the
front end from functioning if accessed otherwise. Server-side dependencies can
be installed using [npm][]. Install it and see the installation instructions
below.

On the other side, clients must support [HTML5][], a JavaScript based on
[ECMAScript 5][] and [Web Storage 2][].

And on top of that an instance of the back end version 1.06.6.1 has to be
available at address 127.0.0.1 and port 9000.

Installation
------------

1. Configure the HTTP server to serve the top-level directory of this
   distribution.

2. In that directory, run `npm run install:javascript` in order to install the
   application dependencies and to compile the sources into JavaScript.

Contributions
-------------

Following commands might be useful during a development:

* `npm test` to recompile the sources into JavaScript and to start an HTTP
  server that serves the application at <http://0.0.0.0:8080/>.
